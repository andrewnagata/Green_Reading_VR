Knowing how the ground undualtes is important to putting well. In order to learn how a green "breaks" it's important to spend time on that green rolling putts. The problem is that most golf courses do not let players linger on greens for their own practice. Other players are on the course, and play must remain at a constant pace. So, how do we study individual greens given that we have limited access to them?

What if we could scan a green and study it in VR? This would give players ample time to explore the breaks of a given green. There could be ways of presenting the terrain that are specific to VR, enhancing the players understanding beyond seeing the green in reality. If we think of each model as a kind of data display, how can we visualize the terrain to best suit golfers who want to learn how theor ball rolls on specific greens?

The process would go something like this: Scan a green. Import and clean the model. Wrap a VR experience around the models that allows players to see the green in novel ways that enhance their understanding of the terrain.
